		The members benefit by getting cheap loans from the organization. 
		Membership to the organization is by registration.

		interests.

		group pays Kshs. 5,000.

		During the registration of individuals, personal details are captured.
		<br>
		When registering a group, details of the group and those of its 
		individual members are captured.

        <span class = "list-group-item">
		<p>
		An individual member contributes a monthly share of not less than 
		Kshs. 1,000 to the organization.
		<br>
		For those registered under a group, each member contributes a monthly 
		share of not less than Kshs. 1,000 where Kshs. 200 is the group share 
		contribution by the member.
		<br>
		All monthly contributions are treated as shares for the contributor and 
		attract annual dividends.
		</p>
		<img class = "img-rounded" style = "width : 100%; height : auto; margin-bottom : 1%;" src = "{{url_for('static', filename = 'deposit.jpeg')}}">
		<p>
		Members can borrow loans from the organization based on their total 
		shares. Members registered as individuals can be loaned up to three 
		times their share contribution.
		<br>
		The repayment period does not exceed three years and the loan attracts 
		interest at a rate of 1.2% per month on the principal amount borrowed.
		<br>
		Members registered under a group can be loaned up to four times their 
		individual share contribution.
		<br>
		The repayment period does not exceed four years and the loan attracts an 
		interest at a rate of 1% per month on the principal amount borrowed.
		<br>
		A group can also get a group loan, amounting to three times the groupâ€™s 
		total share contribution which attracts interest at a rate of 0.8% per 
		month payable within five years.
		<br>
		All payments to the organization are monthly and must be made by the last 
		day of the month.
		<br>
		Any defaulted payments are penalized at a rate of 10% per month.
		</p>
		<img class = "img-rounded" style = "width : 100%; height : auto; margin-bottom : 1%;" src = "{{url_for('static', filename = 'interest.jpeg')}}">
		<p>
		Every end of the year, the organization determines the total interest 
		charged on all loans and total penalties on defaulted amounts.
		<br>
		60% of this amount is paid as dividends to the shareholders each getting 
		an amount proportional to their total share contributions. The balance 
		is retained to run the organization.
